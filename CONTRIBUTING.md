## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

**SQL Guidelines**
```sql
-- Use clear, descriptive table and column aliases
SELECT 
    v.vendor_name as supplier_name,
    v.vendor_tier as supplier_tier,
    SUM(s.spend_amount) as total_annual_spend
FROM vendor_dimension v
JOIN spend_fact s ON v.vendor_id = s.vendor_id

-- Include comments for complex business logic
-- Calculate supplier performance tier based on spend and performance
CASE 
    WHEN total_spend > 1000000 AND performance_score >= 4.0 THEN 'Strategic'
    WHEN total_spend > 100000 AND performance_score >= 3.5 THEN 'Preferred'
    ELSE 'Approved'
END as calculated_tier

-- Use consistent formatting and indentation
-- Optimize for readability and maintainability
```

**Schema Design Principles**
- Follow established naming conventions (snake_case for tables/columns)
- Include appropriate constraints and indexes
- Document all tables and complex fields
- Maintain referential integrity
- Consider performance implications of design choices

**Documentation Standards**
- Use clear, concise language accessible to both technical and business audiences
- Include practical examples and use cases
- Provide both conceptual overviews and detailed implementation guidance
- Keep documentation current with code changes

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes and corrections
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `performance/` - Performance optimizations
- `schema/` - Database schema changes

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of the change, including:
- What was changed and why
- Any breaking changes or migration requirements
- Testing performed and results

Closes #issue-number
```
